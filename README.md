# Extreme_heat_SICB

A defining feature of ongoing rates of anthropogenic climate change is the increasing frequency, intensity, and severity of extreme weather events. Among them, extreme heat is recognized as a critical driver of ecological and evolutionary change. Yet its integration into organismal biology remains limited, in part because heatwaves are difficult to define consistently and are not part of standard climatological or biological toolkits. Short periods of extreme heat can exceed physiological limits more than future mean temperature projections, restructure geographic ranges, and accelerate extinction risk. Here, we present a methodological framework for incorporating extreme weather into studies of behavior, physiology, mechanistic niche modeling, species distribution modeling, and population dynamics. We provide examples and accompanying code to obtain extreme temperature metrics at hourly scale and long-term climatological resolutions. First, we outline reproducible approaches for defining and quantifying extreme heat events. Second, we present a species distribution model that incorporates metrics of extreme heat for the California Quail (Callipepla californica) showcasing improvements in habitat suitability, particularly at range edges where species are vulnerable. Third, we integrate high-resolution microclimate modeling with biophysical simulations to quantify exposure and thermal stress of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa), allowing precise estimates of body temperatures during heat events across microclimates. Finally, we provide an example of population modeling that embeds the history of thermal exposure, demonstrating how extreme heat drives unexpected risks of population collapse and individual mortality. This integrative framework offers a methodological roadmap and open code for anticipating organismal responses and refining vulnerability assessments. As heatwaves intensify, incorporating their dynamics is essential for understand ecological and evolutionary change, designing experiments across speciesâ€™ geographic ranges, and supporting conservation in a rapidly warming, and more unpredictable, world.
